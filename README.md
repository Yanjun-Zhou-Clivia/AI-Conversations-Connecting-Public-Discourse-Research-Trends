[Analyzing AI Discussions Across Academic (arXiv) & Social Platforms (Reddit & Youtube)](https://github.com/Yanjun-Zhou-Clivia/AI-Conversations-Connecting-Public-Discourse-Research-Trends/blob/main/Analyzing%20AI%20Discussions%20Across%20Academic%20(arXiv)%20%26%20Social%20Platforms%20(Reddit%20%26%20Youtube).ipynb)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **AI discussions across academic and social platforms** (arXiv, Wikipedia, Reddit, and YouTube) to compare how public discourse aligns with cutting-edge AI research. Using **web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), trend analysis, and machine learning**, we identify key AI topics, engagement patterns, and research adoption trends.

## üìÇ Data Sources
- **Wikipedia AI Glossary (Web Scraping)**: Standardizes AI terminology for keyword tracking.
- **arXiv AI Research Papers (Web Scraping)**: Provides structured metadata on emerging AI research.
- **YouTube API (API Integration)**: Extracts video metadata (views, likes, and comments).
- **Reddit API (API Integration)**: Scrapes posts from AI-related subreddits (upvotes, comments, frequency).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Data processing & automation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models.
- **PRAW, Google API Client**: Web scraping.
- **NLTK, WordCloud**: Natural language processing.

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Extracted AI-related content from **Wikipedia, arXiv, YouTube, and Reddit**.
- Tokenized and cleaned text data for **keyword tracking and sentiment analysis**.
- Standardized terminology using **Wikipedia AI Glossary**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trend & Engagement Analysis
- Identified **most discussed AI topics** and their frequency over time.
- Analyzed **Reddit vs. YouTube engagement patterns** (best posting times, user interactions).
- Compared **public discourse vs. academic research trends**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Topic Extraction & Prediction
- **Word Clouds & NLP**: Identified dominant AI-related terms across platforms.
- **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)**: Predicted future AI discussion trends.
- **Wikipedia-Term Mapping**: Evaluated public understanding of AI concepts.

## üîç Key Findings
- **ArXiv drives cutting-edge research, Reddit connects theory with applications, and YouTube reflects industry trends & public interest.**
- **YouTube has wider reach, while Reddit fosters deeper technical discussions.**
- **AI discussions peak in the evenings (6-10 PM) across both platforms.**
- **AI-generated content is a hot topic across both platforms, with growing concerns about deepfakes and automation.**
- **Many trending AI terms lack strong academic presence, suggesting a gap between research and public perception.**
- **AI ethics, bias, and misinformation are recurring themes in public discourse but have limited presence in arXiv papers.**
